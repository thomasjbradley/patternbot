*Your pompous and persnickety patterning robot.*

![](.readme/screenshot.png)

There are lots of fantastic tools for creating style guides and pattern libraries—but they all have a lot of embedded knowledge (command line, Gulp, Grunt, PHP, Handlebars, SASS, etc.)

It’s just too much *stuff* for my students. I don’t want them to have to learn the tool, I want them to use a tool and get on with designing.

My aim is not to replace the wonderful tools that exist, but simplify them into a very minimal GUI package that can get the students familiarized with using style guides without having to learn all the extra stuff.

## Ideas for folder structure

Inspired by lots of other tools that exist.

```
common/
  modules.css
  grid.css             Determine all sizes and create sample layouts.
  type.css             Create a preview using the standard classes.
  theme.css            Use CSS variables inside `:root {}` to define colours & fonts.
patterns/
  buttons/
    index.html
    main.css
    README.md          Could contain element info? Why? Rational?
  lists/
    unordered.html     Each file would be used to generate the examples.
    ordered.html
    main.css
    main.js            JS should also be supported.
  header/
    index.html
    main.css
images/
  icons.svg            Parse all the <symbol> tags and generate icon previews.
  logo.svg
  logo-64.svg          Find all the images that start with `logo` and display them.
  logo-32.svg
  logo-16.svg
  banner.jpg
pages/
  home.html
  about.html
pattern-library.html   The final output. A single HTML file with necessary CSS & JS embedded.
```

## Questions

- Without a preprocessor how do we include all the CSS on the example pages?
  - Link every file at the top?
  - Have Patternbot generate a concatenated file?
- Should Patternbot include a web server? Browsersync?
